# Get started with AI on Azure

## Introduction to AI

- AI: creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities
    - Machine Learning: how to "teach" a model to make predictions and draw conclusions
    - Anomaly Detection: automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system
    - Computer Vision: interpret visual data (camera, video and images)
    - Natural Language Processing: interpret and respond to written or spoken language
    - Knowledge Mining: extract information from large data sets to create a searchable store

## Machine Learning

- Machines learn from data; models train and make predictions based on data relationships
- Azure Machine Learning service: cloud-based platform for creating, managing and publishing ML models
    - Automated ML: creates models from data automatically
    - Azure ML designer: GUI enabling no-code development of ML models
    - Data and Compute Management: data storage and computing resources to experiment at scale
    - Pipelines: orchestrate model training, deployment and managing tasks

## Anomaly Detection

- ML technique to analyze data over time to identify unusual changes
    - Once a model is trained on its expected parameters, data outside expectations can raise alerts
    - Azure Anomaly Detector service is an API provided for these types of models

## Computer Vision

- Deals with visual data processing
- Examples include image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, image analysis, face detection/analysis/recognition, optical character recognition
- Azure provides:
    - Computer Vision Service: analyze visual data to extract descriptors, tags, objects and text
    - Custom Vision: train custom image classification and object detection models
    - Face Service: build face detection and facial recognition solutions
    - Form Recognizer: extract information from scanned forms and invoices

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Examples:
    - Analyze and interpret text
    - Interpret spoken language and synthesize responses
    - Translate between languages
    - Interpret commands
- Azure services:
    - Language: features for understanding text, training language models to understand spoken or text-based commands
    - Translator: translate text between more than 60 languages
    - Speech: recognize and synthesize speech, translate between spoken languages
    - Azure Bot: platform for conversational AI to allow agent to participate in conversation
        - Bot Framework allows integration with other back-end services

## Knowledge Mining

- Solutions that involve extracting information from large volumes of usually unstructured data
- Azure Cognitive Search: tools for building indexes
- Leverages other AI services to index previously unsearchable data

## Challenges and Risks with AI

- Bias can affect results
- Errors may cause harm
- Data can be exposed
- Solutions may not work for everyone
- Users must trust a complex system
- Who's liable for AI-driven solutions?

## Understanding Responsible AI

- **Fairness**: AI systems should treat all people fairly
- **Reliability and Safety**: AI systems should perform reliably and safely
- **Privacy and Security**: AI systems should be secure and respect privacy
- **Inclusiveness**: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people (all people)
- **Transparency**: AI systems should be understandable
- **Accountability**: poeople should be accountable for AI systems
